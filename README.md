# FreeCodeCamp OOPs Project

This project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python, including inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism.

## Getting Started

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Clone the repository and execute the main script                                                                                             ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RiyaRaj28/OOPs_freeCodeCamp_Python.git
   cd freecodecamp-oops-mini-project
   python main.py

## Classes

## Item

Represents an item with a name, price, and quantity. Provides methods for applying discounts and increments.

## Phone

A subclass of `Item`, representing a phone. Inherits methods from `Item` and provides its own implementation for discounts.

### Keyboard

A subclass of `Item`, representing a keyboard. Inherits methods from `Item` and provides its own implementation for discounts.

## OOP Concepts

## Inheritance

Demonstrated by `Phone` and `Keyboard` classes inheriting from `Item` class to reuse code and extend functionality.

## Encapsulation

Implemented by making variables private within classes, preventing direct modification from outside the class.

## Abstraction

Implemented by abstracting irrelevant details from the user and exposing only essential information and functionalities.

## Polymorphism

Demonstrated by using the `apply_discount()` method on different item types (`Phone` and `Keyboard`), showing different behaviors based on the object type.


This project was fundamental to my understainding and building of basics of important OOPs concepts.
