# Class method is for instantiating instances from some structtred data we have.
# These are used to manipulate different structures of data
# Here, we created a class method responsible to read the csv file and created somem instance


# Static method creates functions related to class objects, so we define it inside the class. 
# But we can define it outside also and it won't be wrong. 
# This should do something related to class, but not something that must be unique per instance.isinstance
# It does not pass the object reference as the first object in the backgrd

# Class methods and static methodss can also be called from instances.(not really required)

# item1 = Item()
# item1.is_integer(5)
# item1.instantiate_from_something()
